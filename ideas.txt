  -  a mode that exits of dictionary lookup fails.
     Especialy needed for sam support.
     maybe if dictnotfound yields __EXIT__ -> exit.
     (1) miniscule sentinel issue;
     (2) how to specify. Extra / modifier tied to dictionary? simply --fdict-MAP/__EXIT__ .
     (3) reverse SAM support: default strict, flag to allow permissive.

  /  add structure to the compile 'data structures', e.g. expanded_compute and ::compute.
     during compilation perhaps use hashes to increase legibility.

  ?  protect against log(-1) etc
  -  challenge: combine ed and map. replace substring with its map. First ,get it and ,map, then ,ed it.
        currently: echo -e "_a_\t3\n_b_\t4\naba\t5" | pick -AiK --cdict-foo=a:Alpha,b:Beta x::1^_'(.)'_,get^foo,map 1::1^'_\K(.)(?=_)':x,ed
        where \K is available since Perl 5.10.0, 2007. Requires some perl, doesn't look great, but works.
     ?  edmap => [ 3, sub { $::STACK[-3] =~ s/$::STACK[-2]/my $x = $::dict{$::STACK[-1]}{$1}; defined($x) ? $x : $1/e  } ],
        echo -e "_a_\t3\n_b_\t4\n_d_\t8" | pick -AviK --fdict-foo=dict --cdict-foo=a:Alpha,b:Beta,c:Gamma 1::1^'%5E_\K(.)(?=_$)'^foo,edmap
     -> $1 not the right control? You might want to replace more than just $1, using the map of $1.
        the two-step solution will allow this.
  ?  get: option to return field if no match? -> covered by ed; get allows filtering on empty string with uie
  ?  predefine constants (e.g. log10, pi). new syntax, e.g. ^^PI ^^LOG10 ^^E ^^PHI - no real need.
  ?  implement in C or Rust (use pcre2). string/float/int the main point of pain.
  #  -T pushes column; slightly inelegant but inevitable. -N -L fixed as rowno lineno operators.

  x  similar to --sam also --fastq (columns 1 2 3 4), --fasta (1 2) ?  unlikely, use bioawk for that.
     note --fasta-dict-NAME= and --fastq-dict-NAME= to make sequences available.

  x  Alternative implementation to pstore: push header with $_ . '_ref', push @F with with @F_ref.
     Then -A requires @header_orig as one kind of fiddliness. Also $::N, $B_printall
     Better to write a separate utility for this kind of self-join.

  x  numerical comparisons check field is numeric; however duplicates perl's work/warnings

  x  --group-all -> do not skip first row (re-populate %::pstore_cache from %::pstore_init)
     problematic that repopulation only happens after compute finished. This is fine if first
     row is skipped, but pretty impossible for the first row. Current status: overreach.
