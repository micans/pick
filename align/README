Initial commit of scripts/data to *further* test aspects of SAM functionality, e.g.

  - query sequence retrieval / requirement of name-ordered SAM input / test we exit or warn if footing is lost
      - difference between --sam/fname.fa and --fasta-dict=fname.fa
      - correct treatment of sequences/alignments that are secondary (256) or supplementary (2048)
      - currently unmapped (4) reads lead to exit and require pre-filtering. Worth being gracious?
  - improve documentation. Most things are one-based in SAM-land, but some are not (e.g. _sam_rbt_x)



======

Creation of reference.
The first is F1 with other sequence surrounding it.
The second is F2, reverse complemented, with other sequence surrounding it

  echo -e "F1\tSEA1 F1 SEA2\nF2rc\tSEA3 <F2> SEA4" | ../utils/makedna.pl > ref.fa


======

Creation of reads, as below, all with left and right decoration
{F1}      perturbed F1
{F2}      perturbed F2
{<F1>}    perturbed rc-ed F1
{<F2>}    perturbed rc-ed F2

  for i in {1..10}; do
    echo -e "readF1-$i\tfoo bar zut {F1} doo wah tik\nreadF2-$i\tfoo bar zut {F2} doo wah tik\nreadF1-$i-rc\tfoo bar zut {<F1>} doo wah tik\nreadF2-$i-rc\tfoo bar zut {<F2>} doo wah tik" | ../utils/makedna.pl 0.04 0.04 0.04 5
  done > qry.fa


======

cat qry.sam | pick --sam -A @2/none/4 |  ../utils/samdisplaymatches.sh ref.fa
